### Project Description

Egg Mates is a playful social web app for people who discover matching secret codes on egg-puff sticks. Enter a code, find your Egg Mate, reveal each other's profiles, and start chatting in real time.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Sometimes you eat an egg puff, find a mysterious stick code, and are left wondering whether your destiny is holding the matching stick in another tea shop. Humanity deserved answers.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We turned snack-stick fate into a social network. Egg Mates matches two people with the same secret code, celebrates their reunion with egg-themed confetti, and gives them a chat room to break the ice.

### Implementation

For Software:

# Installation

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Run [`supabase/migrations/001_egg_mates.sql`](./supabase/migrations/001_egg_mates.sql) in the Supabase SQL Editor.
3. Add your project URL and publishable/anon key to `supabase-config.js`.

```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd [your-project-folder]
```

# Run

Serve the project with a local static server, such as VS Code Live Server, then open `index.html` in the browser.

```bash
python -m http.server 5500
```

Open `http://localhost:5500` in your browser.

## Project Documentation

For Software:

# Screenshots (Add at least 3)

![Sign-up screen](./screenshots/signup.png)
*The Egg Mates sign-up screen, including profile-photo options.*

![Secret-code matching](./screenshots/code-matching.png)
*A user enters a secret code to find their matching Egg Mate.*

![Egg Mate chat](./screenshots/chat.png)

# Diagrams

![Workflow](./screenshots/workflow.png)
*Profiles are stored in Supabase, matching codes create independent connections, and each connection receives its own real-time chat room.*

For Hardware:

Egg Mates is a software-only project. A device camera is optionally used to capture a profile photo.

## Project Demo

# Video

[Add your demo video link here]
